# account-service Documentation

Each service owner need to create a design document before writing the service.

[Design document](./design.md): This document is used to detail out implementation details. The implementation
details include OpenAPI document, sequence diagrams, domain model, and important business logic.

There are two directories:

1. [diagrams](./diagrams): This directory is used to store Draw.io diagrams that you will draw while creating design
   document.
2. [images](./images): This directory is used to store images that will be used by documents in JPEG or PNG format.
